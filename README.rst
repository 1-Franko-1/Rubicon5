Rubicon 5
=========

-----------------------------------------------------
The latest step in your favorite lunatic Discord bot.
-----------------------------------------------------

Rubicon 5 brings plenty of new features to the same old bot, with a better codebase, more readable code, better modularity, and more.

So, what *is* Rubicon?
=======================

| Rubicon is a Discord bot, mostly centered around an AI, with some little features to make it more interesting.
| It's written in Python, and uses the `discord.py` library to interface with Discord.
| Additionally, it's designed to be very modular, and easily extensible. Add new features or remove even core ones with ease.

What can it do?
================

| Rubicon, while it is centered around an AI, does not *only* revolve around AI.
| It has a ton of random features, a more notable one being inter-server bridging.
| It also has fun little games, and other miscellaneous features that make it more interesting.
| A jack-of-all-trades, if you will.

What's new in Rubicon 5?
=========================

| Rubicon 5 is a complete rewrite of the in-beta Rubicon 4.
| Rubicon 4 was meant to clean the codebase up, but with the modularity system, only made it more messy.
| Rubicon 5, on the other hand, will keep a continuous focus on readability, maintainability, and other important factors.
| Additionally, it reworks the modularity system, adds a ton of more utilities, etc.
| It also handles dependencies more gracefully, and should overall be more robust.
